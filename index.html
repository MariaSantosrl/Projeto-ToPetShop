	 						</h3>
	 						<p>The Siberian Husky has two layers of fur, which protect the dogs from the intense cold. The undercoats are very soft and the upper coat has an average length. During the moulting season they let loose a lot, especially in Brazil and in places where the weather is warmer! The colors are the most diverse and range from pure white to combinations of white with gray (more common), black, red and brown.</p>

	 						</h3>
	 						<p>The fur of the Pug is very short, thin and soft. The colors of the breed are: silver, apricot, fawn and black. Having the snout and black ears is also part of the characteristics of the Pug's coat. They loose a lot of hair all year long, so a daily brushing helps remove dead hair and prevent it from falling and spreading throughout the house. You can use a specific glove for pets if the task is not as satisfactory with the use of a regular brush.</p>

	 						</h3>
	 						<p>The Samoyed dog has long, thick legs. Therefore, hair loss is quite large especially in Brazil, where we have a different climate than the breed was accustomed to. It is necessary to brush around three times a week in common times and daily during the hair exchange that happens mainly in the summer and spring, to decrease the amount of fall and make the dog more comfortable.</p>

	 							<a href="#" class="btn btn-danger">Dálmata</a>
	 						</h3>
	 						<p>The Dalmatian coat is his signature. They are pure white, unvarying, and with black spots or liver color (dark brown) and rounded shape throughout the body. The hairs are short and hard, but at the same time they are smooth and shiny. Dalmatian pups are born all white, the spots begin to appear from the second week of life. The bad news is they loose too much hair! You can, and should, brush it often to remove the dead hair before they fall, but this will not prevent frequent dropping, especially in Brazil.</p>

	 						</h3>
	 						<p>With long, thin, silky hairs, the Yorkshire has a coat of steel-blue color and brown (golden) that ranges from the darkest at the root to the lightest at the tips. The puppies of the breed, however, are born with the black and brown hairs that lighten as the animal grows. It needs regular brushing, but Yorkshire does not loose much hair. Knots, however, can be a problem for tutors, who often end up preferring to keep their pets with the "baby cud", where the hairs get shorter and easier to maintain.</p>

	 						</h3>
	 						<p>The Cubs Vira Latas can present several types and colors of coat. Despite this, it is easy to define an average pattern: short and dark or cream. This is because of the mix of breeds that a Vira Lata dog may have, making the most dominant genetic inheritances usually the most present. The Cubs Vira Latas tend to be healthier than other dogs because they are more resistant . Contrary to popular belief, this resistance is not gained by the fact that they have already become ill and have become immune to them (and not all dogs have lived on the street, for example)..</p>
